# A Dias

Hi! A being driven by coffe â˜• and curiosity ðŸš€, I'm an explorer seeking to discover more things and to find new ways to understand the world. 

Currently studying software development fundamentals and also imersing in a back-end Java bootcamp!

I love the idea of getting to know people from all arround the world through our own way to see and approach things. I'm really excited to see what the years to come have yet to show me!
